        <h3>Seasoned beef wrapped in puff pastry</h3>
        <p>This Scottish recipe belongs to my Grandmother. It is simple, quick and keeps 
            well as left overs. Made with ground beef and famous A1 steak sauce, be 
            sure to leave the bottle out for dipping! Serve with mashed potatos and 
            brussel sprouts.</p>
